
EDA Inferences for Cleaned Sales Dataset:

1. Summary Statistics:
   - 'sales' and 'value' are both positively skewed with some high-value outliers.
   - Mean sales per record is approximately 557.13.
   - Dataset includes data across 3 unique categories, 3 products, and 4 regions.

2. Histograms:
   - 'sales' distribution is right-skewed, indicating a few high-revenue transactions.
   - 'value' follows a similar pattern but generally on a lower scale.

3. Boxplots:
   - Outliers are present in both 'sales' and 'value', especially in certain categories.
   - Median sales differ significantly across categories.

4. Pairplot:
   - 'sales' and 'value' are positively correlated.
   - No strong visible correlation between product/category and numerical values in pairwise plots.

5. Correlation Matrix:
   - 'sales' and 'value' show a high positive correlation.
   - Encoded categorical features like 'region' and 'category' show limited correlation with numerical values.

6. Categorical Analysis:
   - Certain products and categories generate higher average sales.
   - Regional differences in sales suggest geographic trends in purchasing.

7. 3D Scatter Plot:
   - High sales tend to cluster in specific categories.
   - Interactive plot shows regional grouping along sales and value axes.

8. Patterns/Trends:
   - Some products are consistently high revenue across all regions.
   - A few categories dominate the sales distribution.

9. Anomalies:
   - Some records show unusually high sales or value—potential outliers or bulk transactions.

10. Feature Inferences:
   - 'category' and 'product' are strong indicators of sales performance.
   - 'region' may influence purchasing behavior based on sales variation.
